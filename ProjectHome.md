ExpressMatch is a Java based system designed to help creation and management of online mathematical expression datasets with ground-truth data. In this system, handwritten model expressions can be input and manually annotated with ground-truth data; transcriptions of these expressions can be automatically annotated by matching them to the respective models.

ExpressMatch is being developed using Netbeans IDE and Java DB relational database
management system (RDBMS).
